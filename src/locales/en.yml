  title: Project Graph Visualization Tool
  intro:
    - >-
      This is a tool for quickly drawing node graphs based on the Tauri
      framework, suitable for project topology diagram drawing and quick
      brainstorming drafts.
    - >-
      Xmind can only be used for drawing tree-structured diagrams, while FigJam
      and draw.io can be used for drawing but they are a bit slow to open in the
      web.
    - Therefore, we developed this small software.

      We are committed to designing the fastest and most convenient drawing
      methodology for "graph theory" and are also exploring and innovating in
      the direction of visual thinking and topological todo lists.
