  protectingPrivacy:
    title: Privacy Protection
    description: |
      When taking screenshots for feedback, enabling this option will replace all Chinese characters with "å¥½" to protect privacy.

      You can turn it off and restore it after providing feedback.
  renderEffect:
    title: Rendering Effect
    description: Whether to render special effects. If the application is lagging, you can turn this off.
  historySize:
    title: History Size
    description: |
      This value determines the maximum number of times you can undo using Ctrl+Z.
      If your computer has very little memory, you can reduce this value.
  autoNamerTemplate:
    title: Auto Naming Template
    description: |
      Enter `{{i}}` to automatically replace the node name with a number. The number will be incremented automatically when you double-click to create a new node.
      For example, `n{{i}}` will be automatically replaced with `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, etc.
      Enter `{{date}}` to automatically replace with the current date. The date will be updated automatically when you double-click to create a new node.
      Enter `{{time}}` to automatically replace with the current time. The time will be updated automatically when you double-click to create a new node.
      You can combine them, for example, `{{i}}-{{date}}-{{time}}`.
  autoSaveWhenClose:
    title: Automatically save the project file when clicking the close button in the upper right corner of the window
    description: |
      When you close the software, if there are unsaved project files, a prompt will appear asking if you want to save.
      With this option enabled, the project file will be saved automatically when you close the software.
      Therefore, it is recommended to enable this option.
  autoSave:
    title: Enable Auto Save
    description: |
      Automatically saves the current file.
      This feature currently only works for files with existing paths and does not work for draft files!
  autoSaveInterval:
    title: Auto Save Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Note: Currently, the timer only counts when the software window is active and does not count when the software is minimized.
  autoBackup:
    title: Enable Auto Backup
    description: |
      Automatically backs up the current file.
      An automatic backup will be created next to the project file.
      If it is a draft, it will be stored in the specified path.
  autoBackupInterval:
    title: Auto Backup Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Too frequent automatic backups may generate a large number of backup files,
      which will take up disk space.
  autoBackupDraftPath:
    title: Automatic backup folder path for drafts
    description: |
      Please enter the absolute path. Drafts will be backed up to this folder.
      If left blank or the path is incorrect, no backup will be performed.
      For Windows systems, please use backslashes.
      For example: C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\DraftBackup
      Do not include a path separator at the end.
  scaleExponent:
    title: View Scaling Speed
    description: |
      The "current scale" will continuously approach the "target scale" at a certain rate.
      When the approximation is close enough (less than 0.0001), the scaling will stop automatically.
      A value of 1 means the scaling will be completed immediately without any intermediate transition effect.
      A value of 0 means the scaling will never be completed, which can simulate a locked effect.
  moveAmplitude:
    title: View Movement Acceleration
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The camera can be considered as a hovering aircraft that can spray in four directions.
      This acceleration value represents the size of the jet's power and needs to be adjusted with the friction setting below to adjust the speed.
  moveFriction:
    title: View Movement Friction Coefficient
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the sliding distance, and the smaller the friction coefficient, the larger the sliding distance.
      A value of 0 means absolutely smooth.
  gamepadDeadzone:
    title: Gamepad Deadzone
    description: |
      This setting is used when using a gamepad to control the view.
      The input value of the gamepad is between 0 and 1. The smaller this value, the more sensitive the gamepad input.
      The larger the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to 0 or 1, and there will not be too much change.
      The smaller the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to the middle value, and there will be a larger change.
