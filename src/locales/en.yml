  title: Project Graph Visualization Tool
  introTitle: Introduction
  intro:
    - >-
      This is a tool for quickly drawing node graphs based on the Tauri
      framework, suitable for project topology diagram drawing and quick
      brainstorming drafts.
    - >-
      Xmind can only be used for drawing tree-structured diagrams, while FigJam
      and draw.io can be used for drawing but they are a bit slow to open in the
      web.
    - Therefore, we developed this small software.

      We are committed to designing the fastest and most convenient drawing
      methodology for "graph theory" and are also exploring and innovating in
      the direction of visual thinking and topological todo lists.

    description: "The 'Current Scaling Factor' will continuously approach the 'Target Scaling Factor' by a certain multiplier.\nWhen it gets sufficiently close (less than 0.0001), it will automatically stop scaling.\nA value of 1 means scaling will complete immediately without any transition effect.\nA value of 0 means scaling will never complete, simulating a locked effect."

    description: "This setting is for moving the view up, down, left, and right using the W A S D keys.\nThe greater the friction coefficient, the smaller the sliding distance; the smaller the friction coefficient, the further the sliding distance.\nA value of 0 represents absolute smoothness."
