  intro:
  - Software Introduction
  - This is a tool for quickly drawing topological graphs based on the Tauri framework,
    which can be used for project topology diagram drawing and rapid brainstorming
    drafts.
  - Xmind can only be used to draw tree structure diagrams, while FigJam and draw.io
    can be used for drawing but they are a bit slow to open as web pages.
  - Therefore, this small software was created.

  - We are committed to designing the fastest and most convenient methodology for
    "graph theory" and are also exploring and innovating in the fields of visual thinking
    and topological todo lists.
  - "If you want to get feedback quickly and provide suggestions, or if you have any
    ideas or questions, you are welcome to join our QQ group: 1006956704"

      Therefore, it is recommended to enable this option.
  autoSave:
    title: Enable Auto Save
    description: |
      Automatically saves the current file.
      This feature currently only works for files with existing paths and does not work for draft files!
  autoSaveInterval:
    title: Auto Save Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Note: Currently, the timer only counts when the software window is active and does not count when the software is minimized.
  autoBackup:
    title: Enable Auto Backup

      For example: C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\DraftBackup
      Do not include a path separator at the end.
  scaleExponent:
    title: View Scaling Speed
    description: |
      The "current scale" will continuously approach the "target scale" at a certain rate.
      When the approximation is close enough (less than 0.0001), the scaling will stop automatically.
      A value of 1 means the scaling will be completed immediately without any intermediate transition effect.
      A value of 0 means the scaling will never be completed, which can simulate a locked effect.
      Note: If you feel stuttered when zooming in, please set it to 1
  cameraKeyboardScaleRate:
    title: Viewport Zoom Keyboard Rate
    description: |
      The zoom scale factor of the viewport each time it is zoomed in or out using a keyboard press.
      A value of 0.2 means that each zoom in will increase the scale to 1.2 times the original, and each zoom out will decrease the scale to 0.8 times the original.
      A value of 0 means keyboard zooming is disabled.

  scaleCameraByMouseLocation:
    title: Scale Camera by Mouse Location
    description: |
      When enabled, the center of the camera scaling will be the position of the mouse
      When disabled, the center of the camera scaling will be the center of the current view
  allowMoveCameraByWSAD:
    title: Allow camera movement with W S A D keys
    description: |
      When enabled, you can use the W S A D keys to move the camera up, down, left, and right.
      When disabled, you can only use the mouse to move the camera, avoiding the endless scroll bug.
  cameraKeyboardMoveReverse:
    title: Reverse Camera Movement with Keyboard
    description: |
      When enabled, the direction of camera movement using the W S A D keys will be reversed
      The original movement logic was to move the camera floating on the screen, but some users interpreted it as moving the canvas, which caused confusion
      Therefore, this option was introduced
  allowAddCycleEdge:
    title: Allow adding self-loops between nodes
    description: |
      When enabled, self-loops can be added between nodes, allowing a node to connect to itself, which is useful for state machine drawings.
      Disabled by default, as it is rarely used and may easily trigger accidental actions.
  moveAmplitude:
    title: View Movement Acceleration
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The camera can be considered as a hovering aircraft that can spray in four directions.
      This acceleration value represents the size of the jet's power and needs to be adjusted with the friction setting below to adjust the speed.
  moveFriction:
    title: View Movement Friction Coefficient
    description: |
      This setting is used when using the W, S, A, and D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      The larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the sliding distance, and the smaller the friction coefficient, the larger the sliding distance.
      A value of 0 means absolutely smooth.
  gamepadDeadzone:
    title: Gamepad Deadzone
    description: |
      This setting is used when using a gamepad to control the view.
      The input value of the gamepad is between 0 and 1. The smaller this value, the more sensitive the gamepad input.
      The larger the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to 0 or 1, and there will not be too much change.
      The smaller the deadzone, the closer the gamepad input is to the middle value, and there will be a larger change.
